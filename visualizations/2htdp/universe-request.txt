Subject: Fwd: Universe key handler request

I was cleaning out my inbox and found this. Probably too late, but I
thought I'd still pass it on in case you'd forgotten.

Can you make the key handlers in universe take 3 arguments instead of
2? That is, it takes a world, a key-event and a boolean where the key
event does not include 'release and the Boolean indicates if the key
was pressed down or not.

I guess. Why is this useful?

P.S. and how would you signal the release of a key?

the Boolean!

It is useful for multiple key presses that overlap but it is also
useful that it matches what you think when you look at a keyboard.

Wait. Say I press a key

Ê*------------------------------||-------------------------------------*
Êkey-press Ê Êholding it down Êthe event handler is called with #t Ê more key presses, no release?

when does the program find out that I have released the key?
