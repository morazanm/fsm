A DSL for the Automata Theory Classroom

FSM is a DSL designed to help students understand Automata Theory by
allowing them to construct and minipulate state machines, grammars, and regular expressions..
For instructions on how to download the DSL, view the patch notes, or just browse the code, please see either the offical
FSM readme on @(hyperlink "https://github.com/morazanm/fsm" "Github") or the
new @(hyperlink "https://morazanm.github.io/fsm/index.html" "FSM website").

@table-of-contents[]

@section{Constants}
@defidform[ARROW]
The symbol used to separate the lefthand side from the righthand side
of a grammar rule.

@defidform[BLANK]
In a Turing machine tape, this symbol denotes a blank space.

@defidform[BRANCH]

@defidform[EMP]
The symbol denoting the empty string or character. It cannot be in 
the alphabet of a state machine or grammar.

head to the right.

variable to abstract over the currently read symbol.


@section{Data Definitions}



@defidform[alphabet] A list of symbols representing lowercase letters in the Roman alphabet.

@defidform[word]{
 A @italic{(listof symbol)}. Each symbol is a member of the same alphabet.}

@defidform[letter]{
 A string of length one representing a lowercase letter in the Roman alphabet.}

@defidform[state]  
An uppercase letter (e.g., A) or a symbol comprised of an uppercase 
letter, dash, and number (e.g., A-72431).

@defidform[dfa-rule] 
A (list state symbol state) representing a transition in a 
deterministic finite-state automaton. The symbol must be in the 
alphabet of the machine.

@defidform[ndfa-rule]{ 
 A @italic{(list state symbol state)} representing a transition in a 
 nondeterministic finite-state automaton. The symbol must either be 
 in the alphabet of the machine or be EMP.}

@defidform[pda-rule]{ 
 A @italic{(list (list state symbol pop) (list state push))} denoting a 
 transition in a pushdown automaton. The symbol must be in the 
 alphabet of the machine. The elements to remove from the 
 top of the stack are denoted by pop which is either EMP or
 a list of symbols where the leftmost is first element to pop. 
 The elements to place onto the top of the stack 
 are denoted by push which is either EMP or a list of symbols where 
 the leftmost symbol is the last element to push.}

@defidform[tm-action] 
If an alphabet symbol, it denotes the symbol written to the tape of a Turing
machine. Otherwise, it is the direction in which to move the head:
RIGHT or LEFT.

@defidform[tm-rule]{ 
 A @italic{(list (list state symbol) (list state tm-action))} representing a 
 transition in a nondeterministic Turing machine. The symbol must
 either be either EMP or an element of the machine's alphabet.}

@defidform[mttm-rule]{ 
 A @italic{(list (list state (listof symbol)) (list state (listof action)))} representing
 a transition in a nondeterministic multitape Turing machine. The symbols represent what
 is read on each of the tapes and must be either EMP or an element of the machine's
 alphabet.}


@defidform[dfa-configuration] 
A list containing a state and a word. The word is the unread part of 
the input and the state is the current state of the machine.

@defidform[ndfa-configuration] 
A list containing a state and a word. The word is the unread part of 
the input and the state is the current state of the machine.

@defidform[pda-configuration] 
A list containing a state, a word, and a list of symbols. The state 
is the current state of the machine. The word is the unread part of 
the input. The list of symbols is the contents of the stack where
the leftmost symbol is the top of the stack.

@defidform[tm-configuration] 
A list containing a state, a natural number, and a list of symbols. 
The state is the current state of the machine. The natural number is
the head's position. The list of symbols is the contents of the tape
up to the rightmost position reached, so far, by the machine.

@defidform[mttm-configuration] 
A list containing a state and one or more tape configurations. A tape
configuration is a list containing a natural number for the head's
position and a sublist representing the contents of the tape.

@defidform[terms] Lowercase letters.

@defidform[nts]
A set of nonterminal symbols. A nonterminal symbol is an upercase
letter in English: A..Z. That is, FSM programmers are limited to 26 nonterminals.
The internal representation in FSM may use symbols of the form nts-<digit>^+
(e.g., A-72431). Such nonterminals may not be directly used in an FSM program.

@defidform[rrule] A regular grammar rule is a list of 
the following form:
@itemlist[@item{(S ARROW EMP)}
          @item{(N ARROW a)}
          @item{(N ARROW aB)}]
S is the starting nonterminal, N and B are nonterminal symbols, and 
a is a terminal symbol.

@defidform[cfrule]{ A context-free grammar rule is a list of the
 form @italic{(A ARROW J)}, where A is a nonterminal symbol and J is either
 EMP or an aggregate symbol of terminals and nonterminals.}

@defidform[csrule]{A context-sensitive grammar rule is a list of the
 form @italic{(H ARROW K)}, where H is an aggregate symbol of terminals and
 at least one nonterminal and K is either
 EMP or a an aggregate symbol of terminals and nonterminals.}
