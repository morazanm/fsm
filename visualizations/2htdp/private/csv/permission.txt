Subject: Re: csv package

Matthias, sure, you guys may include it, if you want to.

I have to retain copyright, since it's used by people with several non-PLT Scheme implementations.

If LGPL 3 license is a problem, and you're looking for a LPGL 2.x, I could change the license.

I've attached a ".zip" file of the sources of the latest version.  PLaneT has the sources for the specific version you mentioned.  Let me know if you need something else.

Cheers,
Neil

Neil, would it be okay with you if I provide your csv package from the core:

 (require (planet neil/csv:1:2/csv))

If so, could you send me your sources? Thanks -- Matthias
